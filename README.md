CLP(Set) in miniKanren
======================

A prototype of CLP(Set) in miniKanren.

Implemented the rewrite rules as described in
[_Sets and Constraint Logic Programming_ by Dovier et al](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=365169).
The prototype is feature-complete wrt to the paper.

I also double-check the [CLP(Set) tests](clpset-tests.scm) by running
them in [`{log}`](http://people.dmi.unipr.it/gianfranco.rossi/setlog.Home.html),
a CLP(Set) implementation in Prolog.
